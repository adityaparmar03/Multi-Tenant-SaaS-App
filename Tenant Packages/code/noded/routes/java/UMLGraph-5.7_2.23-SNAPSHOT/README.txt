UMLGraph - Declarative Drawing of UML Diagrams

UMLGraph allows the declarative specification and drawing of
UML class and sequence diagrams.  You can browse the system's
documentation from the doc/index.html page, or print it from
doc/indexw.html.

To install the elements required to run UMLGraph, simply copy
the contents of the lib directory to a location consistent with
your installation's conventions (for example to /usr/local/lib).

To compile the Java doclet from the source code run ant on the
build.xml file.

If you change the source code, you can run regression tests by
executing "ant test".
